# sftardcal

This is a serial port utility designed for POSIX systems and Windows, that was
specifically intended to make command/control and general serial port stuff
much easier than it could have been

Additionally it can perform basic xmodem transfers as well as initializing
the arduino interface via the 'RTS' line.

In many ways it's also a good example of the kinds of things you need to do
in order to write a serial port client application, either in Linux (or BSD),
or in windows.
